# thorstenalpers.github.io

This is a fork of old my asp.net razor page application. At first I hosted the app on Azure, after the first bill I decided to move to github.io.
The difference is that this contains just static files.

It is hosted under github.io.


Requirements: node.js and npm

npm install -g libman
npm install -g typescript
